# E190uLab1
## Lab1 Write-Up
#### Introduction:
Built a controller

#### Design Methodology:
Having six face buttons for "street fighter" style inputs was my main concern when designing this controller.

After arranging the buttons and the left stick in a way that felt comfortable for me to hold in my hand, I realized that the right stick placement would no longer fit comfortably on the starting piece of wood we were given.  This gave way to the nintendo 64 style design that I ended up with.  I cut down a piece of wood and wedged a shim between it and the controller base.  This was all cemented using liquid nails.  I then screwed in the "right" stick onto the center piece of wood and epoxied a button onto the reverse side (similar to the "z" button on the nintendo 64 controller).

I placed two more buttons above the six "street fighter" buttons on the face to serve as typical "start" and "select" buttons.  As a fighting game player, it is important to me that the start and select buttons are not easy to press accidentally.

#### Testing Methodology:
After soldering all the buttons together, I plugged them into separate locations on the breadboard connected to the arduino.  I tested them for connectvity by holding one end of a multimeter to the grounded port of the arduino and one to the corresponding location while also pressing the button down.  If the multimeter detected a connection while the button was depressed, the connection was solid.  I used the same testing method for the switch's on state.

#### Results and Discussion
In order to comfortably be able to play a first person shooter like quake and still have the street fighter style buttons, the nintendo 64 style layout was necessary.  However, given more time, I would have probably tried to incorporate the third handle in a more smooth and form-fitting manner.

#### Conclusions
Time spend on lab: about 6 hours.
Buttons a switch and two control sticks were attached to a wooden board as a make-shift controller.  Learning how to solder and making mistakes along the way was probably the most time consuming part of this lab.  In the future, it might be better to ensure that everyone in the class can solder properly.
